# Comprehensive Error Handling and Notifications Guide

This guide explains the enhanced error handling, notification, monitoring, and audit logging systems implemented for the CI/CD pipeline.

## Overview

The enhanced error handling system provides comprehensive coverage for CI/CD operations through multiple integrated components:

- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Prevents cascading failures
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for transient failures
- **Error Categorization**: Automatic classification of error types
- **Advanced Notifications**: Multi-channel, templated notifications with rate limiting
- **Monitoring Integration**: Health checks and alerting
- **Error Recovery**: Automated recovery and self-healing
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging and compliance tracking

## Components

### Environment Configuration

Update `.github/config/environments.yml` and `.github/config/notifications.yml` to customize behavior for different environments.

## Error Handling Strategies

### 1. Transient Errors
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Circuit breaker protection
- Health check validation

### 2. Permanent Errors
- Immediate failure reporting
- Detailed error analysis
- Manual intervention guidance

### 3. Critical Errors
- Immediate escalation
- Automatic rollback (if configured)
- Multi-channel notifications
- Compliance logging

### 4. Security Errors
- Mandatory manual review
- Enhanced audit logging
- Immediate team notification
- Automatic workflow suspension

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Health Check Endpoints
- `/health` - Basic application health
- `/metrics` - Prometheus metrics
- `/ready` - Readiness probe
- `/live` - Liveness probe

### Alert Conditions
- Service down (any health check fails)
- High response time (>5 seconds)
- Multiple endpoint failures
- Circuit breaker activation
- Recovery failure

### Escalation Procedures
1. **Low Severity**: Slack notification
2. **Medium Severity**: Slack + Email
3. **High Severity**: Slack + Email + Teams
4. **Critical Severity**: All channels + PagerDuty + Escalation webhook

## Compliance and Audit

### Audit Trail Components
- Structured logs with correlation IDs
- Sensitive data masking
- Retention policies
- Integrity checksums
- External aggregation

### Compliance Features
- GDPR-compliant logging
- Data classification
- Automatic retention management
- Audit trail integrity
- External system integration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Circuit Breaker Stuck Open**
   - Check failure threshold configuration
   - Verify timeout settings
   - Review error patterns

2. **Notifications Not Sent**
   - Verify webhook URLs
   - Check rate limiting
   - Review notification templates

3. **Recovery Failures**
   - Check rollback version availability
   - Verify recovery strategy configuration
   - Review error categorization

4. **Monitoring Alerts**
   - Verify health endpoint accessibility
   - Check timeout configurations
   - Review alert thresholds

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting log level to 'debug' in audit logger:

```yaml
- uses: ./.github/actions/audit-logger
  with:
    log-level: 'debug'
    # ... other parameters
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always use correlation IDs** for tracking operations across components
2. **Configure appropriate timeouts** for your environment
3. **Test error scenarios** in non-production environments
4. **Monitor circuit breaker states** to identify systemic issues
5. **Review audit logs regularly** for compliance and optimization
6. **Customize notification templates** for your team's needs
7. **Set up proper escalation procedures** for critical environments
8. **Use environment-specific configurations** for different deployment targets

## Performance Considerations

- Circuit breakers prevent resource exhaustion
- Rate limiting prevents notification spam
- Exponential backoff reduces system load
- Health checks provide early failure detection
- Audit logging is optimized for minimal performance impact

## Security Considerations

- Sensitive data is automatically masked in logs
- Webhook URLs should use HTTPS
- Secrets are properly managed through GitHub Secrets
- Audit trails maintain integrity through checksums
- Compliance mode enables regulatory compliance
