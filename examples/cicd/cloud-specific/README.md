## Architecture Patterns

### Serverless Pattern (Recommended for Most Use Cases)
```
Internet → Cloud Load Balancer → Serverless Container Platform → Backend Services
```

**Pros:**
- Zero infrastructure management
- Automatic scaling to zero
- Pay only for actual usage
- Built-in monitoring and logging

**Cons:**
- Cold start latency
- Platform vendor lock-in
- Limited customization

**Best for:** Variable traffic, development/staging, cost optimization

### Managed Container Pattern
```
Internet → Load Balancer → Container Orchestration → Managed Nodes → Backend Services
```

**Pros:**
- More control over infrastructure
- Consistent performance
- Better for steady workloads
- Ecosystem integration

**Cons:**
- More complex setup
- Always-on costs
- Requires more operational knowledge

**Best for:** Production workloads, steady traffic, compliance requirements

### Hybrid Pattern
```
Internet → CDN/Edge → Multiple Cloud Regions → Backend Services
```

**Pros:**
- Global distribution
- High availability
- Performance optimization
- Disaster recovery

**Cons:**
- Most complex setup
- Higher costs
- Multi-cloud management

**Best for:** Global applications, critical workloads, regulatory requirements

## Configuration Management

### Environment Variables
All cloud deployments support environment-based configuration:

```bash
# Core rwwwrse configuration
RWWWRSE_PORT=8080
RWWWRSE_HOST=0.0.0.0
RWWWRSE_LOG_LEVEL=info
RWWWRSE_LOG_FORMAT=json

# Health and metrics
RWWWRSE_HEALTH_PATH=/health
RWWWRSE_METRICS_PATH=/metrics

# TLS (usually handled by cloud platform)
RWWWRSE_ENABLE_TLS=false

# Route configuration
RWWWRSE_ROUTES_API_TARGET=http://api-service:3001
RWWWRSE_ROUTES_API_HOST=api.example.com
RWWWRSE_ROUTES_APP_TARGET=http://app-service:3000
RWWWRSE_ROUTES_APP_HOST=app.example.com
```

### Secrets Management
Each platform provides secure secret storage:
- **AWS:** Systems Manager Parameter Store, Secrets Manager
- **Google Cloud:** Secret Manager
- **Azure:** Key Vault

### Configuration Examples
```bash
# AWS Systems Manager
aws ssm put-parameter --name "/rwwwrse/api-key" --value "secret-value" --type "SecureString"

# Google Cloud Secret Manager
gcloud secrets create rwwwrse-api-key --data-file=-

# Azure Key Vault
az keyvault secret set --vault-name rwwwrse-vault --name api-key --value secret-value
```

## Monitoring and Observability

## Security Best Practices

### Platform Security Features
- **AWS:** IAM roles, VPC networking, Security Groups
- **Google Cloud:** IAM, VPC networks, Identity-Aware Proxy
- **Azure:** RBAC, Virtual Networks, Network Security Groups

### Application Security
```yaml
# Common security configuration
environment:
  - RWWWRSE_CORS_ORIGINS=https://example.com
  - RWWWRSE_RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true
  - RWWWRSE_RATE_LIMIT_RPS=100
  - RWWWRSE_SECURITY_HEADERS_ENABLED=true
```

### Network Security
- Use HTTPS-only communication
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Use platform-native firewalls
- Enable audit logging

## Cost Optimization

### Serverless Platforms
- Configure appropriate CPU and memory limits
- Use concurrency controls to prevent over-provisioning
- Implement proper health checks to avoid unnecessary cold starts
- Monitor request patterns and optimize accordingly

### Container Platforms
- Right-size container resources
- Use spot instances where appropriate
- Implement horizontal pod autoscaling
- Use reserved instances for predictable workloads

### Multi-Region Deployments
- Use traffic-based routing to minimize cross-region costs
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Consider data transfer costs between regions

## Disaster Recovery

### Backup Strategies
- **Configuration:** Store in version control with Infrastructure as Code
- **Data:** Use platform-native backup services
- **Secrets:** Replicate across regions using platform tools

### High Availability Patterns
```yaml
# Multi-region deployment example
regions:
  primary: us-east-1
  secondary: us-west-2
  
failover:
  health_check: /health
  timeout: 30s
  retries: 3
```

### Recovery Procedures
Each platform directory includes:
- Automated failover configurations
- Manual recovery procedures
- Testing and validation scripts

## Migration Strategies

### From On-Premises to Cloud
1. **Containerize application** (if not already done)
2. **Choose target platform** based on requirements
3. **Deploy to staging environment**
4. **Validate functionality and performance**
5. **Plan traffic migration strategy**
6. **Execute cutover with rollback plan**

### Between Cloud Platforms
1. **Deploy to new platform** alongside existing
2. **Implement traffic splitting**
3. **Validate performance and costs**
4. **Gradually migrate traffic**
5. **Decommission old platform**

### Cloud-to-Cloud Examples
Each platform directory includes migration guides for common scenarios.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Container won't start** - Check logs and resource limits
2. **Health checks failing** - Verify endpoint configuration
3. **High costs** - Review resource allocation and usage patterns
4. **Performance issues** - Check metrics and consider scaling

### Platform-Specific Debugging
